Digturd.io is a simplistic game which aims to replicate Digdig.io, with the only exception being the digger is a turd.

## Why are you making this game?
I'm making this game for experience with making games with ticks and entities solo.

This game is WIP and the clientside has not been developed yet. As I continue writing this game, there will be instructions on how to play.
